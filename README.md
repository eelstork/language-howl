# Howl notation support in Atom

## Development notes

For development this can be cloned to `~/.atom/packages`

After updating the grammar and up to npm, update `tree-sitter-howl` version in `package.json` then:

```bash
cd ~/.atom/packages/language-howl
apm install
```

Use `âŒ˜ + SHIFT + P` and `rel` to reload the package.
